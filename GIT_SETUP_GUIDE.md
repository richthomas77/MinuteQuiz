# Push Your Quiz Platform to Git

## Option 1: Using Replit's Git Integration (Recommended)

### Step 1: Connect to GitHub via Replit
1. In your Replit workspace, click the **Version Control** tab (Git icon) in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Create Git Repo"** or **"Connect to GitHub"**
3. Authenticate with your GitHub account
4. Choose to create a new repository or connect to existing one

### Step 2: Commit and Push
1. Stage your changes in the Version Control panel
2. Write a commit message like: "Add AI-powered quiz learning platform"
3. Click **"Commit & Push"**

## Option 2: Manual Git Setup (If needed)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like: `quiz-learning-platform`
3. Don't initialize with README (we have files already)
4. Copy the repository URL

### Step 2: Download and Upload
Since there are Git restrictions in this Replit:
1. **Download the Vercel version**: `quiz-platform-vercel.tar.gz` (already created)
2. **Extract locally** on your computer
3. **Create new GitHub repo** and upload the extracted files
4. **Or** use GitHub's web interface to upload files directly

## Option 3: GitHub Web Interface Upload

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to GitHub.com → New Repository
2. Name: `quiz-learning-platform`
3. Make it public or private
4. Don't initialize with README

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Upload the `quiz-platform-vercel.tar.gz` file
3. Or drag and drop individual files from the `vercel-version` folder

## What Files to Include

### Essential Files for Deployment:
```
vercel-version/
├── api/                     # All serverless functions
├── src/                     # React app code
├── public/                  # Static assets
├── package.json            # Dependencies (includes OpenAI)
├── vercel.json            # Vercel config
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript config
├── tailwind.config.ts     # Styling
├── vite.config.ts        # Build config
└── README.md             # Project description
```

### Don't Include:
- `node_modules/` (auto-generated)
- `.env` files (add secrets in Vercel instead)
- Build artifacts (`dist/`, `.vercel/`)

## After Pushing to Git

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Import from your GitHub repository
4. Set root directory to `vercel-version` (if you uploaded the full project)
5. Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
6. Deploy!
